This is an Undergraduate Project done as part of my Bachelor's Degree in Physics. It involves using a Lagrangian method called Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics to simulate 2 and 3 dimensional toy star models. Here, gravitational attraction, damping forces and pressure contribute to the collapse of a star into equilibrium from a pseudo-random configuration.
